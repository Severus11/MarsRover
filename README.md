# MarsRover
This project is modeled after the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html) and it will give you first hand experience with the three essential elements of robotics, which are perception, decision making and actuation. This project is carried in a simulator environment built with the Unity game engine.
