# MarsRover
This project is modeled after the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html).It gives the first hand experience with three essential elements of robotics: perception, decision making and actuation. This project is carried in a simulator environment built with the Unity game engine.
